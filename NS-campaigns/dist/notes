Campaign Sync [Tim re: Matthew's remarks]:

"Create a Campaign" should take users to a new page
    - we need to be able to give ppl a link to create a new Campaign
    - incorporate this into the "Edit Campaign Page"

"First, Last Name and Email" Not needed
   - Just have "Enter Your campaign name" + "Timeline"

Change CTA "Back to Campaigns" to "CANCEL"

--------------------------------------------------------------

"Luke's Campaign is live!" to overlay NEW live campaign page

Replace copy of "Be the first to donate!" instead of "Given of $12k"

Have a title over the social icons like "Spread the word" in the "Recent Activity"
    - Alway have this anchored under recent Activity

Solid #00BAE0 for progress bar
